Calender
## Introduction
 I decided to make project on Calender. A calendar is a chart or device which displays the date and the day of the week, and often the whole of a particular year divided up into months, weeks, and days. A calendar is a particular system for dividing time into periods such as years, months, and weeks, often starting from a particular point in history.It is a system of organizing days. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system.

 ## Research
The basic calender doesn't involve any of the operations related to finding interests. It is easy to apply. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way. As in the calender can be printed on the papers through that we can get to know the days,weeks,date etc. All the information regarding the festivals good muhutas and the remeberables days and we can make a note under that so the specific day we can remember it.

## Cost and Features
As far as the project is well built and all the requirements met the cost can be varied according to the market.
### Features
No. of days present in a month.
No. of months present in a year.
No. of days present in a week.
It can detect that on what date which day of week and the important note we can note under the dates. 

# Defining the system

The system mainly involves three operation modes. They are dates declaration,  day declaration  and other note making modes for all important dates. All the operation modes are subdivided into required dates and days where user can choose the operation he wants and can perform accordingly. The result will be displayed at the end.

### WHO 
 The project can be used almost by all. All the  employees and students and every one in this world can use the program to find out the answer they need. At the end,  user satisfaction is the goal  of the project.
### WHAT
Calculations related to basic math and days and dates can be calculated quickly. All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

### WHEN
The project can be used at the time of fixing any program to check with the day and date they can go through  the calender
and get the results for basic allotment of the dates for the certain programs related problems. The result will be obtained quickly.

### WHERE
In all the domains it can be used. As the project is portable and user-friendly, it can be easily implemented on the mobile systems and finance companies. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements. As without the dates and days no one can plan anything according to the requirement they can plans all the required dates.

### HOW
System design is a solution for “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
